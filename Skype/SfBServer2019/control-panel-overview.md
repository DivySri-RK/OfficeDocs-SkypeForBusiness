# Control Panel

The current Control Panel is a new version of the legacy Control Panel, with which it exists in tandem. The new Control Panel came into existence from the Cumulative Update of July 2019, and it has undergone further enhancements in the Cumulative Update of November 2024. It helps manage the configuration of servers, users, clients, and devices in the environment of an organization.

The legacy Control Panel might not work as Silverlight technology reached the "end-of-support" stage on October 12, 2021. For more information, see [Silverlight End of Support](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/silverlight-end-of-support-0a3be3c7-bead-e203-2dfd-74f0a64f1788).

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you don't use the legacy Control Panel anymore, and disable it. For information on how to disable the legacy Control Panel, see [Disable Legacy Control Panel (CSCP)](/SkypeForBusiness/plan/disable-legacy-control-panel).

## Access Control Panel

To launch the new Control Panel in the browser, enter https://&lt;pool-FQDN&gt;/macp or a configured simple URL.

The new Control Panel includes commonly used menu items that cover most of the needs of the organization.
