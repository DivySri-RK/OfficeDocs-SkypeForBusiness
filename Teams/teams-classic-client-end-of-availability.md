# End of availability for classic Teams client

## Overview

After March 31 2024, a new Teams client will be rolled out, in stages, for users who are still on classic Teams. The roll out means installing the new Teams client for users who still have the classic Teams client, and uninstalling the classic Teams client 14 days after the installation of new Teams.

After this process is complete, classic Teams will be unavailable for different users as outlined in this table:

|Availability area                                | Date         |Link |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----|

## Timeline updates

This rollout is going to differ based on your Teams Admin Center policy controls.

- Microsoft-managed rollout: If you left the policy controls at their defaults, we'll continue rolling out new Teams as per the schedule outlined above, with one update: We won't proceed with the uninstallation of the classic Teams client for 14 days.
- Admin-managed rollout: Admins can choose to control the new Teams rollout as outlined in [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md). These policies will no longer work at the start of April, apart from your VDI users, and the following changes will happen:
  - New Teams will become the default client. The toggle to return to classic Teams will still be available if needed.
  - In mid-May, new Teams will be installed, and the toggle to return to classic Teams will no longer be available. We will attempt to uninstall classic Teams, currently after a period of 14 days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We're aware of the concerns around our timeline. Classic Teams users who have encountered issues moving to new Teams or who don't meet the prerequisites to upgrade will still have access to the classic Teams client until July 01 2024 at the earliest. This will give admins more time to address any issues encountered during this process.

## User experience

### What users will see until April 01 2024

Starting in March 2024, any classic Teams users who haven’t updated to new Teams will begin seeing an informational banner to remind them about the timeline for the Microsoft AutoUpdate. This banner will appear in the main Teams client window at the top of the page (underneath the main bar).

:::image type="content" source="media/teams-client-eol-switch-banner.png" alt-text="Shows the banner in Teams client that reads 'Classic Teams won't be available. You'll be switched to the new Teams after availability ends. Switch now.' Switch now is a selectable link.":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can dismiss this banner in every client session until the end of February 2024, but it will reappear with each client launch.

Classic Teams will remain available to use until March 31 2024. However, we highly encourage admins to update their users to new Teams, as new features are only being added to the new Teams client. Learn more in the [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md) article.

If users are on an unsupported OS (including Win 10 LTSC), you’ll see a slightly different banner messaging:

:::image type="content" source="media/teams-client-eol-requirements-banner.png" alt-text="Shows the banner in Teams client that reads 'Classic Teams won't be available for use after the end of the availability period. To use the new Teams, update your OS to meet requirements or contact your IT Admin.' Requirements is a selectable link.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Users on a June 30th timeline will see this banner from April 1 2024.

Here's a list of the banner messages you may experience after January 31 2024:

### What users will experience after March 31 2024

After March 31 2024, if you’re already running on new Teams, there will be no change in behavior. Your Teams will continue working as expected.

If you are still on classic Teams, the following applies:

- Microsoft-managed rollout: If you left the policy controls at their defaults, we'll continue rolling out new Teams as per the schedule outlined above, with one update: We won't proceed with the uninstallation of the classic Teams client for 14 days.
- Admin-managed rollout: Admins can choose to control the new Teams rollout as outlined in [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md). These policies will no longer work at the start of April, apart from your VDI users, and the following changes will happen:
  - New Teams will become the default client. The toggle to return to classic Teams will still be available if needed.
  - In mid-May, new Teams will be installed, and the toggle to return to classic Teams will no longer be available. We will attempt to uninstall classic Teams, currently after a period of 14 days.

If you're on the June timeline, here's a list of the banner messages you may experience after March 31 2024:

### What happens if we can’t update users to new Teams

Once classic Teams is no longer available for you, you're going to see a dialog similar to this one, and classic Teams won't work for you anymore.

:::image type="content" source="media/teams-client-eol-notification-box.png" alt-text="Teams dialog box that appears after classic Teams no longer works, if you're unable to be updated to the new Teams client. The notification box has a link to requirements and a button that takes you to Teams on the web.":::

To use Teams after this point, install the new Teams client or use Teams on the web.

If you fall under the June 30 2024 list items and you aren’t able to be updated at the end of March, your classic Teams client will continue to run until June 30 2024. There will continue to be a warning banner at the top of your client. We do ask that users update their OS and address any other issues to continue using the Teams client after this time, as new features are only being added to the new Teams client.

## Admin experience

### What admins will see until the end of March 31 2024

Admins have full control over their tenant’s transition to new Teams via the [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md) article.

A bulk installer, including offline capability, is provided for admins who want to deploy new Teams using their own tools and process and use Teams policies to move their users to the desired experience: [Bulk upgrade to the new Microsoft Teams client](new-teams-bulk-install-client.md).

Microsoft highly recommends that admins who want more control or a more gradual rollout of new Teams take advantage of these tools and functionality to begin slowly transitioning their users to new Teams now. Policies can be targeted to individual users, groups of users, or your entire tenant to give you flexibility to release to users group by group while monitoring progress and feedback.

### What admins will experience starting April 01 2024

In the Teams admin center:

- Microsoft-managed rollout: If you left the policy controls at their defaults, we'll continue rolling out new Teams as per the schedule previously outlined, with one update: We won't proceed with the uninstallation of the classic Teams client for 14 days.
- Admin-managed rollout: Admins can choose to control the new Teams rollout as outlined in [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md). These policies will no longer work at the start of April, apart from your VDI users, and the following changes will happen:
  - New Teams will become the default client. The toggle to return to classic Teams will still be available if needed.
  - In mid-May, new Teams will be installed, and the toggle to return to classic Teams will no longer be available. We will attempt to uninstall classic Teams, currently after a period of 14 days.

## Frequently Asked Questions

> [!NOTE]
> The unavailability of classic Teams and dates mentioned in this article don't currently apply to Windows 10 users signed into Teams for Life or users signed into both Teams for Life and Teams for Work.

### Users

- **If a user has both clients installed:** Only new Teams will work after the end of availability, and we'll attempt to uninstall the classic Teams client.
- **If only the new Teams client is installed:** There won’t be any difference.
- **If a user can’t install the new Teams client due to a reason outlined in the previous table, such as unsupported OS (including Win 10 LTSC):** These users will be allowed to use classic Teams until June 30, 2024 (as per above schedule) to allow for updating operating system to modifying permissions etc. After June 30 2024, classic Teams won't work.

### Admins
