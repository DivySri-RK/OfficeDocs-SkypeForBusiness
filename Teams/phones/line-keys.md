# Line Keys on Microsoft Teams Certified Phone Devices

This article provides guidance on setting up and managing line keys on Microsoft Teams certified phone devices. This feature allows users to set up custom contacts and speed dial for quick access using line key buttons on nontouch devices and sidecars.

## Steps to set Up line keys

To set up line keys for custom contacts and speed dials, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Teams phone application:** After updating the application, you'll notice a new home screen experience on your device with a dedicated place for line keys.
2. **Assign a contact for speed dial:** Select on **Assign line key** and search for an existing contact including a PSTN contact, or add a new one.
3. **Modify or manage an assigned line key:** Long press an existing line key to see a detailed menu with the following options:
    - **Unassign line key:** To remove an assigned line key.
    - **Reassign line key:** To modify the contact assigned to this line key.
    - **Manage line key:** Access more management options.
4. **Place a call:** Press or select on the key to place a call to the user or number assigned to that line key.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Question:** When will line keys be supported on touch phone devices?  
**Answer:** Support for touch phone devices is coming soon. Check the public roadmap for timelines. With this application update, line keys are available for nontouch devices and devices with sidecars.

**Question:** Can line keys be configured on the Teams Admin Center with this update?  
**Answer:** No, currently configuration support is only through the device.

**Question:** What other functions can I perform using line keys?  
**Answer:** With this update, you can use line keys for quick access to speed dial only. In the future, we'll support line keys for call controls and offer enhancements for shared line configuration.

**Question:** Does this change the existing functionality of sidecars?  
**Answer:** Before the Teams application update to 1449/1.0.94.2024101709, users were able to add contacts to sidecars if the account was marked as a Favorite, speed dial, or assigned as a Boss. Additionally, users had the option to pin groups to sidecars. With this update, contacts on sidecars can only be added by configuring them as line keys on the sidecar. Saved configurations continue to appear on the sidecar with this app. Any further edits will only happen through line key management as described above. We'll make changes to streamline this experience on sidecars in the future.
