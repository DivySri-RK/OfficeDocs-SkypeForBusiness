# Manage the Queues app for your organization in Microsoft Teams

## Overview of Queues

[insert Queues overview text here]

## Licensing

Users must have a Teams Premium license to use Shifts.

## Set up Queues

### Enable or disable Queues in your organization

Shifts is enabled by default for all Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on the app at the org level on the [Manage apps](../../manage-apps.md) page in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

1. In the left navigation of the Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.
2. In the list of apps, search for the Queues app, select it, and then switch the **Status** toggle to **Blocked** or **Allowed**.

### Enable or disable Queues for specific users in your organization

To allow or block specific users in your organization from using Queues, make sure Queues is turned on for your organization on the [Manage apps](../../manage-apps.md) page. Then create a custom policy for app permissions and assign it to those users. To learn more, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](../../teams-app-permission-policies.md).

### Pin Queues to Teams

#### Use an app setup policy to pin Queues to Teams

App setup policies let you customize Teams to pin the apps that are most important for your users.

You can create a [custom policy in app setup policy](../../teams-app-setup-policies.md) by adding the Queues app, and then [assign the policy](../../assign-policies-users-and-groups.md) to your users.

## Give feedback or report an issue

To send feedback or report an issue, select **Settings and more** (**â€¦**) in Teams, and then choose **Help** > **Give feedback**. Enter your feedback or details about the issue you're experiencing. Indicate at the beginning of your feedback report that you're sending feedback about Queues so we can easily identify Queues issues.
