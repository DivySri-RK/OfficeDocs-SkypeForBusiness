# Copilot in Microsoft Teams

Team Copilot is inherently multiplayer in that it includes shared output, where all users in the mode see the exact same synthesis.


Microsoft Teams is introducing Copilot to provide a shared summary, or a synthesis, of a of the most important information in a single mode (one chat, channel post, or meeting). Information from that mode is synthesized into a shared canvas, which keeps everyone in the mode on the same page as the conversation happens. Users focus on communicating naturally and Team Copilot synthesizes that communication into output. Team Copilot is an active synthesis of ongoing work.

Most importantly, Copilot for Teams provides users with key insights from the chat without the user having to ask Copilot for it. Currently, in order to get insights from Copilot, users need to either use a pre-built prompt or know what to ask. By having a pre-built synthesis, we make key information readily available for all users in the moment, without further action on their part.

Teams Copilot also contiuously works as the chat progresses. Copilot is a shared view of the current state of the discussion, it ensures alignment across a group of collaborators. It shows options being considered and then replaces those with a single choice once the decision has been made.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While this information is communally shared to appropriate participants, when individual users query Copilot in regard to this information, those queries and responses from Copilot remain private to that user.

## Defining synthesis

A synthesis of information refers to the process of combining multiple sources or pieces of data into a coherent and integrated whole. This can involve analyzing, summarizing, and organizing information in a way that highlights important insights and connections between different elements of communication.

The goal of information synthesis is to create a more complete and nuanced understanding of a topic or subject by pulling together diverse strands of evidence or perspectives.

## Security, Purview, and Privacy

XXX Probably going to need some of this in here. Point to all-up MS policy links?

## Configuring Copilot in Microsoft Teams

XXX Steps an admin will need to take to configure Copilot. Probably steps for permissioning in here at a minimum.
