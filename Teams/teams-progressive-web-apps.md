# What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that can be installed on a device and provides a user experience similar to a native desktop app. PWAs allow sites like Teams on the web to offer additional desktop capabilities that are typically unavailable to websites.

PWAs are hosted by Microsoft Edge and Chrome browsers but look and feel like a native app. At their core, PWAs are still websites and operate within the same browser sandbox environment, offering the security and control many administrators require for their users. b to offer additional desktop capabilities that are typically unavailable to websites.
