# Manage Cloud Voicemail settings for users

Voicemail settings allow you to configure voicemail settings for individual users.

Before configuring voicemail settings for your users, you should read [Set up Cloud Voicemail](set-up-phone-system-voicemail.md). For information about setting policies for groups of users, see [Manage Voicemail policies](manage-voicemail-policies.md).

The default settings for Cloud Voicemail are:

- Voicemail is enabled.
- The prompt language is set to the userâ€™s preferred language.
- The out-of-office greeting is disabled.
- The out-of-office greeting, when automatic replies are set in Outlook, is disabled.
- The out-of-office greeting, when the calendar in Outlook shows out-of-office, is disabled.
- Sharing of voicemail and transcription data with the service for training and improving accuracy purposes is disabled.
- The call answering rule is set to Regular Voicemail.
- The default greeting prompt overwrite isn't set.
- The default out-of-office greeting prompt overwrite isn't set.
- The transfer target isn't set.
- Play out-of-office greetings is disabled.

To manage Cloud Voicemail features for your users, you can use the Teams admin center or PowerShell. Your end users can also configure these settings in the Teams client by going to **Settings -> Calls -> Configure Voicemail.**

## Use Teams admin center

In the Teams admin center:

1. In the left navigation, go to **Users > Manage users** and select the user.

2. On the user details page, go to the **Voicemail** tab.

3. Change the settings.

4. Select **Save**.

## Use PowerShell

You can also use PowerShell to manage voicemail settings as follows:

- To manage Cloud Voicemail settings for individual users, use the  [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailUserSettings](/powershell/module/teams/set-csonlinevoicemailusersettings) cmdlet.

- To view settings, use the [Get-CsOnlineVoicemailUserSettings](/powershell/module/teams/get-csonlinevoicemailusersettings) cmdlet.

- You can disable Cloud Voicemail for a user by using the [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailUserSettings](/powershell/module/teams/set-csonlinevoicemailusersettings) cmdlet and setting the VoicemailEnabled parameter to $false.
