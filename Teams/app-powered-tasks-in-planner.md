# Create app-powered tasks in Planner for tailored task experiences

## Overview

The app-powered tasks feature offers your organization more control over what users see when they open their tasks in the Planner app within Microsoft Teams. Instead of showing only the standard set of task fields, you can provide users with an experience tailored to the task at hand. That experience might be a workflow-specific set of fields or step-by-step guidance to walk the user through a workflow from beginning to end. To achieve this, you integrate a Teams app with the task and create these tasks programmatically.

Say, for example, users in your organization use a Teams app to track and complete inspections. You choose to integrate this inspections app with tasks so that a Planner task is created for each inspection tracked in the system.

- When a user opens one of these tasks from the Planner app in Teams, they see a simplified screen with a button to jump directly to the inspection experience powered by your inspections app.
- When they complete the task and exit the inspections experience, they're right back in Planner where they started.

Users get the tailored experience that a Teams app provides right from within their assigned tasks. They don't have to navigate to a different app to get work done or lose context of where they were when working with their tasks.

In addition to these benefits when users complete tasks, the app-powered tasks feature allows organizations to reflect required line-of-business (LOB) processes and workflows as tasks, so employees can see all tasks assigned to them from a single place.

This experience is supported in the Planner app on Teams web, desktop, and mobile. You can update any Teams app to create app-powered tasks and provide tailored task experiences for your users.  

## Requirements

App-powered tasks is an extensibility feature that relies on programmatic creation and management of tasks. The requirements to use this feature are as follows.

- Each app-powered task must have a reference URL that points to an experience in a destination Teams app. We recommend that you point this reference URL to the specific item or screen the user should be working on. This reference URL must be added to the task in a specific way. To learn more, see the [How to configure the reference URL](#how-to-configure-the-reference-url) section of this article.
- Tasks must be created and updated using the [business scenarios](/graph/api/resources/businessscenario-planner-overview?view=graph-rest-beta) API in Microsoft Graph.
- Users who need to work with the task must have access to the destination app in Teams, as governed by the app policies you set in the Teams admin center. To learn more, see [Overview of app management and governance in Teams admin center](manage-apps.md).
- The destination Teams app is responsible for managing the task lifecycle, which includes the following actions:

  - Create the task. See [Create businessScenarioTask](/graph/api/businessscenarioplanner-post-tasks?view=graph-rest-beta).
  - Assign the task. See [Update businessScenarioTask](/graph/api/businessscenariotask-update?view=graph-rest-beta).
  - Update the task, if properties change. See [Update businessScenarioTask](/graph/api/businessscenariotask-update?view=graph-rest-beta).
  - Mark the task as Completed when all steps are done. See [Update businessScenarioTask](/graph/api/businessscenariotask-update?view=graph-rest-beta).
  - Delete the task. See [Delete businessScenarioTask](/graph/api/businessscenarioplanner-delete-tasks?view=graph-rest-beta).

    Some workflows might not have deterministic flows. For example, a finding during an inspection might result in the inclusion of several more steps in the inspection. As the Planner app can't determine whether all required steps are completed, this feature allows your Teams app to govern the lifecycle of the task. Similarly, users are prevented from updating task fields or marking the task as Completed. These actions might result in users making changes that conflict with what's reflected in your Teams app.

## Create an app-powered task

Here's an overview of how to use the [Create businessScenarioTask](/graph/api/businessscenarioplanner-post-tasks) API to create an app-powered task.

What differentiates an app-powered task from a standard task is the presence of a specific attachment. This attachment contains a link (reference URL) to the destination experience in the Teams app, which enables Planner to recognize a task as an app-powered task.

Note that the API refers to these attachments as [references](/graph/api/resources/plannerexternalreferences?view=graph-rest-beta).

### Define the attachment

To define the attachment, specify the following properties.

```http
        "references": { 
            "{reference-URL}": { 
            "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.plannerExternalReference", 
            "alias": "{destination app name}", 
            "previewPriority": "!", 
            "type": "TeamsHostedApp" 
         } 
       } 
```

- The reference URL that points to the destination experience in Stageview Modal link syntax. For more information, see the [How to configure the reference URL](#how-to-configure-the-reference-url) section of this article.

- `alias`: The name of your Teams app. When a user opens the task, they see a message that says, â€œComplete this task in <**alias**>", and a **Start task** button to jump to the destination experience.

- `previewPriority`: Leave as `!`.

- `type`: Set to `TeamsHostedApp`.

#### How to configure the reference URL

##### Format the URL

The reference URL to the destination experience must use [Stageview Modal link syntax](/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/open-content-in-stageview) in the following format:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/{Teams-app-Id}/0?context={"contentUrl":"URL-to-destination-experience"},"name":"{desired-page-title}","openMode":"modal"}`

Specify the following parameters in the reference URL:

- `Teams-app-Id`: The app ID of the Teams app you're integrating with the task.
- `contentUrl`: The URL that points to the specific experience in your destination Teams app that you want users to see when they open the task. The domain of the URL must be a valid domain for the app ID.
- `name`: The title that should appear at the top of the screen when the user is shown the `contentUrl`.

Here's an example of a reference URL before encoding:

  `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.youtube/0?context={"contentUrl":"https://tabs.teams.microsoft.com/youtubeContentStage?videoId=HBGmSy1iVmY","name":"Security%20talk","openMode":"modal"}`

In this example:

- `Teams-app-Id` is the app ID of the YouTube app in Teams (`com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.youtube`). Keep in mind that most Teams app IDs are alphanumeric and might look different.
- `contentUrl` points to the experience within the destination Teams app (`https://tabs.teams.microsoft.com/youtubeContentStage?videoId=HBGmSy1iVmY`).
- `name` is the name of the screen title (`Security talk`) when loading the URL.
- `openMode` is set to `modal`.

If the YouTube app in Teams is available to you, you can send this URL to yourself and confirm it opens.

##### Encode the reference URL

You need to encode the reference URL before using it in the attachment. Percent encoding ensures the link is in a compatible format for programmatic use. Follow these steps to encode the reference URL:

1. Percent encode the part of the URL that comes after `0?context=`. Don't encode `https://` or `=` (the equal symbol), or any of the characters in between.

      `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.youtube/0?context=%7B%22contentUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Ftabs.teams.microsoft.com%2FyoutubeContentStage%3FvideoId%3DHBGmSy1iVmY%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Security%2520talk%22%2C%22openMode%22%3A%22modal%22%7D`

      > [!TIP]
      > This is the last step where the link can be easily validated in Teams chat. After you complete this step, you can test the URL by sending it to yourself in a Teams chat. The link should open on Teams desktop, web, or mobile for any user who has access to the destination app in Teams.

1. Replace *all* `.` characters in the reference URL with `%2E`. You must do this across all characters in the reference URL, from beginning to end. If you miss this step, the reference URL might not work.

      The following URL is ready for programmatic use.

      `https://teams%2Emicrosoft%2Ecom/l/stage/com%2Emicrosoft%2Eteamspace%2Etab%2Eyoutube/0?context=%7B%22contentUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Ftabs%2Eteams%2Emicrosoft%2Ecom%2FyoutubeContentStage%3FvideoId%3DHBGmSy1iVmY%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Security%2520talk%22%2C%22openMode%22%3A%22modal%22%7D`

      > [!NOTE]
      > If your URL points to a Power App, make sure ir includes the `&source=teamstab` parameter to make single sign-on (SSO) work for Power Apps and the `&skipMobileRedirect=1` parameter to skip the screen that prompts users to open the standalone Power App player.

### Example

**Request**

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/solutions/businessScenarios/{your-business-scenario-ID}/planner/tasks 

{ 
"title": "{Task title}", 
    "target": { 
        "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.businessScenarioGroupTarget", 
        "taskTargetKind": "group", 
        "groupId": "{Team ID / Group ID}" 
    }, 
    "businessScenarioProperties": { 
        "externalObjectId": "{any unique ID, e.g. ID of the object in your destination app}", 
        "externalBucketId": "{any bucketID from planConfiguration of your business scenario}" 
    }, 
    "assignments": { 
        "{user ID of user you want to assign the task to}": { 
            "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.plannerAssignment", 
            "orderHint": " !" 
        } 
    }, 
    "details": { 
        "references": { 
            "{reference-URL}": { 
                "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.plannerExternalReference", 
                "alias": "{destination app name}", 
                "previewPriority": "!", 
                "type": "TeamsHostedApp" 
            } 
       } 
    } 
} 
```

Here's an example of a request that creates a task named "Review security practices presentation" and assigns it to a user named Adele Vance (user ID 44ee44ee-ff55-aa66-bb77-88cc88cc88cc). This request uses the reference URL example from earlier in this article.

**Request**

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/solutions/businessScenarios/ccd5aa8aebd048bd839a4fa5b7420631/planner/tasks

{
"title": "Review security practices presentation",
    "target": {
        "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.businessScenarioGroupTarget",
        "taskTargetKind": "group",
        "groupId": "769bbf41-70b7-4ea6-a044-a7037358883e"
    },
    "businessScenarioProperties": {
        "externalObjectId": "ABC1",
        "externalBucketId": "1"
        "externalContextId": "String",
        "externalObjectVersion": "String",
        "webUrl": "https://bing.com"
    },
    "assignments": {
        "44ee44ee-ff55-aa66-bb77-88cc88cc88cc": {
            "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.plannerAssignment",
            "orderHint": " !"
        }
    },
    "details": {
        "references": {
            "https://teams%2Emicrosoft%2Ecom/l/stage/com%2Emicrosoft%2Eteamspace%2Etab%2Eyoutube/0?  context=%7B%22contentUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Ftabs%2Eteams%2Emicrosoft%2Ecom%2FyoutubeContentStage%3FvideoId%3DHBGmSy1iVmY%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Security%2520talk%22%2C%22openMode%22%3A%22modal%22%7D": {
                "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.plannerExternalReference",
                "alias": "Security practices presentation",
                "previewPriority": "!",
                "type": "TeamsHostedApp"
             }
        }
    }
}
```

### What this looks like in the Planner app

Here's what the user sees when they open the task in the Planner app in Teams. Selecting the **Start task** button takes the user to the destination experience in the Teams app. In this example, the experience is a security practices video in the YouTube app in Teams.
